# Shopping List
This Repository was for me to play around with cloud data bases and to learn how they work and learn how to use them.

What I did for this was create a shopping list program. What it does
is it uses the key that I had generated and it accesses the data base
Then whenever I am displaying items it queries the data base and will
display any item that does not have the value of zero attached to it.
Also I can select the write to data base function which will allow the 
user to add items to the shopping list. I can also remove items from the 
shopping list by setting the value associated with it to zero. There are also
the ability to have multiple users where each user will only have access to the
data that is associated with their account.

# Development Environment

What I used for this assignmet was

### language
The language that I used for this was python. Even though python does not have the
most support for firebase because it is outdated It was still able to do what
I wanted it to do.
